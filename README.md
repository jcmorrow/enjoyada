# Getting Started

Welcome! This is a clone of bejeweled. I've spent a decent number of hours on
airplanes playing this silly game, and those experiences always left me wanting
to build this, so I finally did! I had never seriously used HTML's Canvas
feature, so I decided to forego React and do a Canvas only rendered version. I
would love to write a WebGL renderer as well at some point.

# Development

Clone this repo and run the `bin/setup` script and you should be good to go!
